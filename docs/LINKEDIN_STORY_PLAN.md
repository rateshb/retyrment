## LinkedIn Story‑Led Marketing Plan (7‑Day Series)

Goal: a narrative arc that moves from **problem → curiosity → solution → proof → features → CTA**.  
Each day is a single post (scheduler‑friendly). Optional image notes included.

## Narrative Structure
- **Day 1–2:** Problem + curiosity hook  
- **Day 3:** Reveal the solution  
- **Day 4–6:** Feature proof points  
- **Day 7:** CTA + early access/demo

## 7‑Day Storytelling Plan

**Day 1 — The Problem (Tension)**  
> Most people track expenses, but still can’t answer one question:  
> “Am I on track for retirement?”  
> That gap is bigger than it looks.

**Day 2 — Curiosity (Why traditional tracking fails)**  
> Spreadsheets show numbers.  
> They don’t show **decisions** — and decisions are what change outcomes.  
> [Image: Blurred table → hint of matrix]  

**Day 3 — The Solution (Reveal Retyrment)**  
> I built **Retyrment** to connect daily money choices to long‑term confidence.  
> One place for income, expenses, investments, loans, insurance, goals, and family.  
> [Image: App navigation or dashboard]  

**Day 4 — Proof 1 (Retirement Matrix)**  
> The retirement matrix gives a year‑by‑year view of corpus growth, inflows, and gaps.  
> It’s not a number — it’s a path.  
> [Image: Retirement matrix view]  

**Day 5 — Proof 2 (What‑If Strategy)**  
> What happens if you stop SIP after 5 years?  
> Or reinvest maturities?  
> Retyrment models scenarios in minutes.  
> [Image: Strategy planner / scenario card]  

**Day 6 — Proof 3 (Risk & Reports)**  
> Monte Carlo simulations show outcome ranges, not just averages.  
> And reports are built‑in (PDF, Excel, full backup).  
> [Image: Simulation chart or reports screen]  

**Day 7 — CTA (Invite)**  
> If you want a walkthrough or early access, let’s connect.  
> Retyrment is built for people who want clarity, not guesswork.
